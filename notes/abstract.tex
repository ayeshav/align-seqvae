\section{Abstract}
We have access to a lot of data available in various domains such as image analysis, time series, including neuroscience. 
There have been several attempts to make complex models work across different datasets, so they don't have to retrained - this is relatively straightforwrd 
for images but much more complex for datasets that are more structures, example, time series datasets. There has been some work but limited to low dimensional systems.
Here, we focus on neurscientific settings and work on aligning data from different animals and sessions performing the same task.

In order to understand the 
underlying computation, latent variable models, specifically VAEs have been popular as they exploit the low dimensional underlying structure in neural population
recordings, example LFADS. We take advantage of this low dimensional structure along with reducndancy of neural representations to align datasets with varying recordings.
